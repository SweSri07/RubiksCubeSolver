# Rubik's Cube Solving App PRD

## TL;DR
A cross-platform app (web and mobile) empowering Rubik's Cube solvers to generate random scrambles, time their solves, access their entire solve history and personal statistics, and request optimal solutions after solving. The app is designed for cubers who know standard notation and want a frictionless way to practice, track improvement, and share results and leaderboards—no unnecessary teaching or paywalls.

## Goals

### Business Goals
- Achieve high user engagement: >30% DAU/WAU within the first 3 months post-launch
- Drive retention: 40% of users record at least five solves within 30 days
- Empower sharing: 20% of users share their dashboard or leaderboard monthly
- Launch and iterate rapidly: Ship MVP on both web and mobile within 6 weeks

### User Goals
- Effortlessly generate accurate scrambles for solo practice
- Reliably time each solve without technical glitches
- View and analyze full solve history, with sorting, averages, and personal best tracking
- Access stepwise optimal solutions on-demand post-solve
- Share performance and leaderboards with friends or communities

### Non-Goals
- Providing instructional content or "how to solve" tutorials
- Implementing advanced analytics (e.g., move tracking, in-depth stats, or AI-driven insights)
- Generating revenue via paywalls, subscriptions, or advertising

- Simple insights (stats at-a-glance)
- Option to reset all data or specific solves

### Solution on Demand (Priority: Medium)
- Button to request the optimal solution after timer stops
- Display solution in standard notation
- Available only after the timer is stopped for each unique scramble

### Sharing & Leaderboard (Priority: Medium)
- Option to share dashboard/leaderboard via link/social/export
- Simple, privacy-safe leaderboard for users who opt in
- View friends' shared solve stats where permissions are granted

## User Experience

### Entry Point & First-Time User Experience
- Users access app via web link or mobile install with a welcoming, minimal, and modern interface
- Quick intro screen highlights key features (scramble, timer, dashboard, solution, sharing)
- Optional sign-in for dashboard and leaderboard (guest mode available for timing only)
- Easy onboarding: Demo scramble and "start your first solve" prompt

### Core Experience
1. **Landing/Start**
   - Tap "New Scramble" to generate scramble pattern, centered and visible
   - Scramble split into notation for easy reading (e.g. color coding, sized text)

2. **Scrambling and Solving**
   - User applies scramble physically to their cube
   - Tap large "Start Timer" button when ready; countdown and timer precision display
   - Timer runs until user taps "Stop" (or presses spacebar for web)
   - Timer auto-stops if phone call/interrupt occurs; user notified if canceled

3. **Viewing and Saving Results**
   - Solve time flashed, with option to name/tag solve (optional)
   - Celebrate new personal bests visually
   - Solve is auto-saved to dashboard history

4. **Progress and Insights**
   - Dashboard screen: Full sortable list of solves, PB/average summary, rolling stats
   - Metrics shown at top: last 5 solves, lifetime solve count, averages, and bests
   - Filters for date or time, ability to delete/undo any entry

5. **Solution Reveal**
   - After stopping timer, tap "Show Solution" to reveal optimal solving sequence for given scramble
   - Solution is shown in official notation with options to copy/share

6. **Sharing**
   - User taps "Share" on dashboard/leaderboard for link, export, or social share
   - Privacy notice before first share; option to anonymize results

### Advanced Features & Edge Cases
- Sign-in with email/social for multi-device sync; solves stored locally for guests
- Responsive: Works offline (last data synced on reconnect)
- Error messages for invalid actions (e.g., showing solution before timing)
- Colorblind-friendly labels for cube notation
- Accessibility: Tab/keyboard shortcuts, ARIA labels, adaptive font sizing

### UI/UX Highlights
- Dark/light mode switch for eye comfort
- Large, high-contrast buttons for key actions
- Dashboard built for instant glanceable insights, no clutter or learning curve
- Responsive: Looks and works great on phones, tablets, desktops
- One-handed use prioritized for mobile design

## Success Metrics

### User-Centric Metrics
- Active Users: DAU/WAU ratio above 30%
- Solve Volume: Average of at least 3 solves per user per session
- Personal Bests: Number of new PBs logged per user per month
- Engagement with Solution Feature: >50% of completed solves have user accessing solution at least once
- Retention: 40% of users returning for new solves after 30 days

### Business Metrics
- Virality: >20% users sharing dashboard/leaderboard monthly
- Conversion Funnel: Time from first app launch to first recorded solve under 2 minutes for 90% of users

### Technical Metrics
- Timer Accuracy: 99.99% precision and no recorded time skips/lags
- Scramble Validation: 100% compliance with official scramble standards
- Uptime: Service availability >99.5%

### Tracking Plan
- Scramble generated
- Timer start/stop (solve completed)
- Solution requested/viewed
- Solve saved to dashboard
- User sorting/filtering actions
- Sharing actions (by type)
- Personal best/new record achieved
- Frequency of dashboard/leaderboard visits

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs
- APIs: Scramble generator, solution algorithm, time tracking, stats aggregation, and sharing endpoints
- Front-End: Responsive, adaptive web and native/hybrid mobile interfaces
- Back-End: Secure user data storage (solve times, history, PBs), session stats management, authentication for sharing

### Integration Points
- Optional: Social sign-in for account creation
- Sharing integration: Native share sheets (mobile), URLs (web), social/meta-app support

### Data Storage & Privacy
- User solve history and dashboard stored securely, locally/encrypted and (if signed in) synced to the cloud
- Explicit privacy policy; dashboard/leaderboard sharing requires opt-in
- No personally identifiable data collected unless user creates account for sharing/sync

### Scalability & Performance
- Minimal server loads—majority of features work offline or client-side
- Solution generation and time processing under 100ms latency
- Designed for quick future addition of new cube sizes or variants

### Potential Challenges
- Preventing exploit/cheating in leaderboards (optional verification methods)
- Maintaining timer precision across device differences
- Ensuring accessibility for all users (keyboard, colorblind, low-vision support)
